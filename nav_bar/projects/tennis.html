Ball</h4>

        <h4 id="mit_title2">ABSTRACT :Over the course of this investigation we look at the dynamics
of a tennis ball traveling through air which we consider to be
an ideal fluid for the purposes of the investigation. The ball
is assumed to be travelling near to the surface of the Earth.
We wish to model the flight of the tennis ball from a specific
starting point as well as model the impact of ”topspin” as the
ball travels through the air. Topspin is a phenomenon (with
which any keen tennis player is well acquainted with) where
by the motion of the air around the rotating ball generates
an additional force, the Magnus force, which further impacts
the dynamics of the motion.</h4>
