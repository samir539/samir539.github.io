        <h4 id="mit_title2">ABSTRACT :This project looks to investigate the nature of illumination
experienced by a horizontal road by two lamps at either side
of the road (the lights being opposite one another). Knowing
how high to place the lamps as well as their optimal power
output are crucial for achieving a homogeneous illumination
of the road. Achieving such homogeneous illumination is
crucial, principally for concerns of safety. Wide roads often
suffer from inhomogenous illumination and this investigation
looks to model the situation to obtain insights into optimal
lamp placement and power.</h4>
