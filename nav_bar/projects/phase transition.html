        <h4 id="mit_title2">ABSTRACT :The aim of the project was to write a program which simulated the behaviour of metal alloys using 
            the metropolis monte-Carlo swapping algorithm. The behaviour of the alloys was simulated taking 
            into account a range of different temperatures, compositions and interaction energies. From this, 
            the project set out to explain why alloys prefer to be random at high temperatures and more 
            ordered at lower temperatures. The results of the simulation would then quantitively describe the 
            behaviour of alloys allowing for a cohesive, convincing explanation to be formulated explaining the 
            behaviour of a range of alloys at a range of temperatures.</h4>
